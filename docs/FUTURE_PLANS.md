# Future Plans

This document outlines future development plans, improvements, and potential features for the prompt-manager project. Items will be added, removed, and updated as development progresses.

## üöÄ High Priority

- [ ] Implement pagination for large prompt collections
- [ ] Add database query optimization and monitoring

### User Experience
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for prompt reordering

## üîß Medium Priority

### Popular Tags ‚Äì Selected State (Follow‚Äëups)
Short list; see details in `docs/features/popular-tags-selected-state.md`.
